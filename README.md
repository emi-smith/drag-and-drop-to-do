## Description

A simple drag and drop to do list. My goal with this project was to dive deeper into accepting user input and store the data to local storage. Learn how to capture multiple inputs and store them in an array, As well as save, get, edit, and update the array in local storage. As well as learning how to allow users to filter, edit, complete, and delete items. As well as learn more about touch events.

This project is currently in progress.

## Project-Status

Currently working on this project

Need to finish the following: - Javascript - Local Storage  
 - Currently working on getting textarea inner text from local storage. - Add category selection to new task array, save and get task with the corresponding category. - Task category to change when it is dragged and dropped into a new category, changes are updated and stored in local storage.

               - Issues I'm having with local storage.
                    - Items are being saved to local storage and all content and text will display until page reload, then everything is displayed, but textarea inner text, which is still stored in local storage.

Issues I came across during the build:
